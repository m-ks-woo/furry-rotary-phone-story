Once upon a time there was a snarky tasmanian devil named Lucy who lived in a 
unbelievably large, coastal forest. She often enjoyed somersaulting around and
torturing the local wildlife with her friends in the forest. One day, while 
somersaulting with some friends, she got stuck in a mud pit. 

Even though Lucy and her friends struggled for a long time, they still failed to escape from the mud pit. After exhausting all strength, Lucy and her friends finally passed out. Lucy felt that she went through bumps in her sleep. After Lucy opened her eyes, she found that she was in a totally different environment.
