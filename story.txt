Once upon a time there was a snarky tasmanian devil named Lucy who lived in a 
unbelievably large, coastal forest. She often enjoyed somersaulting around and
torturing the local wildlife with her friends in the forest. One day, while 
somersaulting with some friends, she got stuck in a mud pit. 

Even though Lucy and her friends struggled for a long time, they still failed to escape from the mud pit. After exhausting all strength, Lucy and her friends finally passed out. Lucy felt that she went through bumps in her sleep. After Lucy opened her eyes, she found that she was in a totally different environment. 
This enviroment just so happens to be in a cage, in the back of a truck, being taken to who knows where. What Lucy didn't know was that the mud pit they got stuck in was from terrible deforestation, and Lucy and her friends were being taken to a rescue nature reservation. Not knowing this, however, Lucy and her friends , once awake, caused a MAJOR ruckus in the back of the truck. They screamed, knocked over theirs and other cages, and caused enough of a ruckus that the truck came to a stop. They saw the back door fling open, and 3 men with guns run in, shooting everything in sight. These bullets, though, were like needles with a little furry tail on them. Lucy got one in the side, and suddenly, things went blurry, to dark, to black.

For the second time in a row, she woke up somewhere totally new. This place, however, was a lot nicer than the back of a truck. It was the nature reservation,
and it reminded her of her home. Her friends were there too, and once they were awake the began to explore their new environment.
